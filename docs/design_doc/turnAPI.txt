Backend/Frontend API
====================

Client sends GET request for turns to:

http://[host]/api/[game-uuid]/

Which accepts the following query parameters:

?currentTurn = Integer (the latest turn the client has)
?requestAmnt = Integer (the number of turns the client wants to fetch). Amounts greater than 50 will be overridden and return 50 turns.
?reverse = Boolean (If the player is working in reverse, defaults to False and not required.)

Assuming the request is well formed, the server will return JSON which follows this schema:

    "type": "turnList"
    "gameID": [UUID string],
    "turnStart": [Integer],
    "turnEnd": [Integer],
    "turns":
