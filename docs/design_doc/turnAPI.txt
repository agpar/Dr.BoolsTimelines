Backend/Frontend API
====================

Client sends GET request for turns to:

http://[host]/api/[game-uuid]/

Which accepts the following query parameters:

?currentTurn = Integer (the latest turn the client has)
?requestAmnt = Integer (the number of turns the client wants to fetch). Amounts greater than 50 will be overridden and return 50 turns.
?reverse = Boolean (If the player is working in reverse, defaults to False and not required.)

Assuming the request is well formed, the server will return JSON which follows this schema:

{
    "type": "turnList"
    "gameID": [UUID string],
    "turnStart": [Integer],
    "turnEnd": [Integer],
    "turns": 
    [
        {
            "type": "turn",
            "turnNum": [Integer],
            "deltas":
            [
                {
                    "type": "delta",
                    "coords": [String of format "X,Y" or null for world vars],
                    "actorID": [UUID String or null for world vars]
                    "varTarget": [String of variable being targeted]
                    "from": [null or current value]
                    "to": [new value]
                },

                ...
            ]
        },
        
        ...
    ]
}
