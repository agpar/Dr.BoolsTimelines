#C361 Project.
Sniff it up.

To teammates:

1. Install Docker and Docker compose.
2. Clone this repository to some directory.
3. Enter that directory and run: `docker-compose build; docker-compose up` to build and start the virtual machines. Hopefully it's that easy!
4. If it works, going to localhost:8000 in your browser should say "It worked!".
