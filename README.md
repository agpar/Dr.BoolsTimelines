#Dr.Bool's Timelines

A prototype educational game designed to teach programming logic by introducing players to a simple
scripting language that can be used to control the behaviour of agents in a 3D world. The game is open
ended, with no concrete goals other than ensuring the survival of your avatar. The scripting language
is intended to closely mirror a real programming language, while being simple to work with.

This project includes a 3D simulation that runs in the browser, a custom scripting language with syntax checker,
the ability to share behaviour scripts and spectate other players simulations.
